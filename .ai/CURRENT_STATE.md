- **Admin coupons:** CRUD (percent/fixed), min order, expiry, usage tracking
- **Admin reviews:** List, delete
- **Admin users:** List, role update, activate/deactivate, delete (protects last admin)
- **Admin Excel export:** 4-sheet XLSX (overview, daily revenue, monthly revenue, product sales with stock), excludes cancelled orders
- **News/blog:** Full CRUD (admin), public listing by category, slug-based detail pages
- **Contact form:** Submit, admin list/status/note management
- **Dark/light theme:** Toggle with localStorage persistence, smooth CSS transitions
- **Search with suggestions:** Horizontal scrollable product cards with images
- **Responsive design:** Mobile-first with drawer navigation, responsive grids
- **Image upload:** Cloudinary integration with 5MB limit, memory storage
- **Rate limiting:** Global (300/15min) and auth-specific (20/15min)
- **Error handling:** Central error handler, Vietnamese error messages
- **Database seeding:** Idempotent seed script with sample data
- **Mini-game (MIU-9 Future Run):** Canvas-based endless runner (1280×720, DPR-aware). Kill-only scoring (no distance points). 3-heart lives system with 2s invincibility frames on damage. Player: Pink cyber cat with arm cannon. Enemies: ground robot (+2 pts), bird robot (+4 pts, flies at jump height, fires red laser every 3s), mouse sword robot (+2 pts, charge/dash with "!" warning at 60% screen width). Controls: W/Space=Jump, S=Duck, F=Straight Laser, A/D disabled. Three game phases: idle→running→gameover. Keyboard input via window keydown/keyup with phase guard. Mobile touch controls (Jump/Duck/Fire). Cyberpunk start screen with enemy previews and kill-only scoring guide. HUD with score + hearts display. Game over overlay with score/best. Gemini integration: server endpoint generates game assets (background, road, player, bird-robot, mouse-robot) via @google/genai + Imagen 3. Client-side asset caching with 24h TTL. Canvas-drawn fallbacks when images unavailable. Admin test mode: admins can start unlimited test games without order requirement via /api/rewards/game/test-start. User play limit: 1 play per completed order (enforced server-side via GameSession unique index).
- **AI chat:** Mock provider (ai/test MockLanguageModelV4), per-user/guest localStorage scoping, debounced streaming persistence (500ms), product recommendation cards from markdown, 20-message server limit, MAX_MESSAGES=18 client guard
- **Product Gallery:** Dedup to show 2 unique Unsplash images per product (thumbnail + main image switching)
- **Checkout address (User):** User.address (profile string) used as default shipping address via synthetic entry; inline edit via profile API; __user_address__ sentinel never sent as addressId
- **Checkout address (Admin):** Address model entries with structured province/district/ward/street; existing behavior preserved
- **Profile email:** Editable email input with Zod validation; backend uniqueness check (409 on duplicate); persists after reload
- **Favorites:** Fixed price/button overlap — pb-12 padding when hideAddToCart prop is true
- **Order creation:** Backend validates address ownership when addressId provided; User.address string used directly when no addressId

### Partially Implemented
- **Email/SMTP:** Config exists in env vars but no email sending code is implemented
- **Payment webhook:** Endpoint exists but relies on external webhook configuration

## Chat History Persistence (verified 2026-08-31)

### Guest users
- History scoped by stable guest session ID (`store3d_guest_xxx` stored in localStorage)
- Survives F5/page refresh
- Different browsers get different guest IDs

### Authenticated users
- History scoped by user ID (`store3d_chat_{userId}`)
- User A never sees User B's history
- Login/logout transitions: `storageKeyRef` updates immediately, `chatId` recomputes via `useMemo`

### Streaming persistence
- Debounced save at 500ms during streaming (not every token)
- `beforeunload` handler flushes pending saves
- Cleanup on component unmount
- `onFinish` does immediate final save (overwrites debounced partial)
- `clearChat` cancels pending saves before clearing

### History size
- Client: MAX_MESSAGES = 18 (kept in localStorage)
- Server: max 20 messages validated by Zod schema
- Older messages trimmed from localStorage on save

## AI Token/Tool Optimization Rules (verified 2026-08-31)

All 10 rules verified in `aiChatService.ts`:
1. **Greeting** → direct response, no DB query
2. **Budget request** → parse budget, targeted product query
3. **No matching product** → fallback to nearest-price products
4. **General conversation** → no DB query
5. **Product-specific** → targeted query
6. **No guessing** → uses actual DB data
7. **Context minimization** → only selects name/slug/salePrice/originalPrice/images
8. **No double tool calls** → parseBudget in mutually exclusive branches
9. **Mock mode preserved** → `config.ai.provider === 'mock'`
10. **Security** → no secrets exposed

## Known Bugs / Issues

- **No critical bugs.** Application is stable.
- Hidden demo credentials in `client/README.md` — potential security concern if repo is public
- `store3d.vercel.app` custom domain points to wrong project (needs dashboard fix)
- News page card heights now equalized via flex layout fix
- Address Book page removed — address management consolidated into Checkout inline edit

## Vercel Deployment — Module Format Fix (verified 2026-08-31)

### Root Cause (confirmed from Vercel runtime logs)
`ReferenceError: exports is not defined in ES module scope` at `api/server.js:2:23`.

- Root `package.json` has `"type": "module"` → Node.js treats `.js` files as ESM by default
- `api/tsconfig.json` has `"module": "CommonJS"` → Vercel compiles `api/server.ts` to CJS (`exports` keyword)
- CJS output loaded as ESM by Node.js → `exports is not defined` crash at line 2, before any handler executes

### Fix Applied
1. **`api/package.json`** (created): `{"type": "commonjs"}` — makes Node.js resolve nearest package boundary for `api/server.js` as CJS
2. **`api/tsconfig.json`**: Kept `"module": "CommonJS"` intentionally — CJS ensures `require()` resolves extensionless relative imports to `../server/src/*` files correctly
3. **`server/src/services/aiChatService.ts`**: Changed static `import from 'ai'` / `import from 'ai/test'` to dynamic `await import('ai')` / `await import('ai/test')` — the `ai` package is ESM-only and cannot be `require()`'d from CJS
4. **`server/src/services/productService.ts`**: Replaced `require('mongoose').Types.ObjectId` with `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` (already imported at top)

### Why Not ESM Output
Changing `api/tsconfig.json` to `"module": "ES2022"` produces ESM output, but ESM requires explicit `.js` extensions in relative imports (`from '../server/src/vercel-connect'`). All server source files would need `.js` extensions added to imports. CJS approach avoids this by letting `require()` resolve extensionless paths natively.

### Verified
- Production endpoints all return correct responses (200 for data, 401 for unauthenticated `/api/auth/me`)
- `/api/health` → 200, `/api/auth/me` → 401, `/api/products` → 200, `/api/products/featured` → 200, `/api/categories/all` → 200

## Known Technical Debt

1. **No client-side tests.** Zero test files in `client/`. No vitest/jest configuration
2. **Limited server tests.** Only 3 unit tests (15 test cases total)
3. **No root README.md**
4. **CORS permissive in development** (`*` when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`)
5. **No request logging** (no morgan)
6. **No API documentation** (no Swagger/OpenAPI)
7. **No CI/CD pipeline**
8. **No environment validation** beyond MONGODB_URI and JWT_SECRET
9. **TypeScript strict mode not enabled** in server
10. **No database migrations** (Mongoose schemaless)
